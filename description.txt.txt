Approach Outline:
The task was to perform topic based sentiment detection to capture
insights related to each review. 

Major Challenge:
The major challenge in this task is to determine multiple topics for each example.
Since language models usually are one-to-one functions, applying them isnt a straightforward task apply them.

Two types of approaches are experimented with

1. Unsupervised method (LDA Clustering) :
-> LDA clustering defines topic classification in the form of a probabilistic model.
-> This approach uses the Tfidf Tokenizer to vectorize each review
   and clusters them based on word frequency. 
-> Each cluster signifies a topic and intersection between topics signifies overlap between examples
-> The visualization of these are presented in an html format which also includes other information
    regaring word frequencies for each topic

The method is not very successful, even though it manages to model topics such as " value for money"

There is a need to capture deeper context within each example


Hence in this approach, I adopt a multi-label classification scheme and perform a binary classification
for each of the topic

Compiled from the dataset there are about 62 classes and is completely skewed towards some of them

2. Supervised method (Multi-label Classification)
To effectively capture context, the BERT pre-trained model is fine-tuned and is follwed by
a dense layer for multi-label classification

The metric used is a just mean squared error over all validation examples
With the above approach, the model achieves a MSE of 0.49

Future Work:
Since the classes are skewed, it would not be prudent to apply the same threshold for all classes

In such a case, dynamic thresholds will be more effective in classification and they can be implemented
 based on the average probability of occurence of each topic in the train dataset

Another school of thought is based on a temporal localization based approach derived from 
action recognition. However, we will need the dataset to be labelled by localizing each topic to a set of words

The approach is derived from the ActivityNet paper (ref: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.00754.pdf)
